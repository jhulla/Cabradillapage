	<font size="4"><p>Japan’s Mount Fuji or most commonly known as “Fuji-san,” is an active Stratovolcano in the southwest of Tokyo. Fuji-san, as the natives like to call it, is among Japan’s “Three Holy Mountains” including Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is situated in Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, standing tall at 3,776.24 meters.</p>
	<p>Mt. Fuji is a symbolic beauty in and around Japan for widely known reasons; it is not only a scenic beauty that attracts tourists from all around the world but also a cultural icon of Japan.The Japanese cultural art and photography is highly inspired by the “snow-capped” mountain and is often witnessed in paintings and pictures.
This is not even half of what Mt. Fuji has to offer. Every year, almost more than a million tourists visit the mountain out of which approximately 300,000 climb up to its peak.</p>
	<p>Climbing the mountain is not taken as a difficult task anymore but rather a calming and pleasing experience because of all the satisfying facilities around, such as accommodation, food, and other fun activities. Not only that, on June 22, 2013, UNESCO announced Mt. Fuji, a World Heritage Site and an important cultural location.</p>
	<p><b>Location:</b> The mountain is located in Yamanashi and Shizuoka ken (prefectures) of central Honshu, Japan, about 60 miles (100 km) west of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area.</p>

	<font size="4"><p> Another very recognizable landmark in Tokyo is the Tokyo Skytree. One of the most recommended places to visit in Tokyo is a towering structure that is the tallest building in Japan. In fact, when the Skytree was built, it was the second tallest building in the world, standing at a height of 634 metres.
	<center><img src="skytree8.JPG" height="400"></center>
	<p>There are two observation decks in the building from where you can get an unforgettable view of Tokyo. There are also shops, cafes, restaurants, an aquarium, a planetarium, a museum and souvenir stores that you can explore when you are visiting the place.</p>
	<p>The plate tectonic shifts that occur because several continental and oceanic plates meet thus leaving Tokyo prone to earthquakes have forced engineers, architects, and builders to include dampers.</p>

	<p>The dampers are connected from the outside to a central shaft of reinforced concrete they act as a protective pillow against a massive earthquake so as it doesn’t destroy the structures and hurt civilians.</p>

	<p>This is a crucial aspect of the building process of the buildings in Tokyo. Every apartment adheres to this rule as they have an emergency package.</p>

	<p>Tokyo Disneyland is a 115-acre theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, near Tokyo. Its main gate is directly adjacent to both Maihama Station and Tokyo Disneyland Station. It was the first Disney park to be built outside the United States and it opened on April 15, 1983. The park was constructed by WED Enterprises in the same style as Magic Kingdom in Florida and Disneyland in California. It is owned by The Oriental Land Company, which licenses intellectual property from The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, are the only Disney parks in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.</p>

	<p>The park has seven themed areas: the World Bazaar; the four traditional Disney lands: Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland; and two mini-lands: Critter Country and Toontown. Many of these areas mirror those in the original Disneyland as they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. Fantasyland includes Peter Pan's Flight, Snow White's Scary Adventures, and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, based on Disney films and characters. The park is noted for its extensive open spaces to accommodate the large crowds that visit the park. In 2022, Tokyo Disneyland hosted 12 million visitors, making it the fourth-most visited theme park in the world and the second-most visited theme park in Asia.</p>

	<font size="4"><p>Fort Santiago is one of the oldest fortifications in Manila built by the Spaniards in 1571 from what was once a palisaded structure of logs and earth built by Rajah Soliman on the native settlement called Maynila. The colonizers recognized that the tongue of land where the Pasig River flowed into the Manila Bay was a very strategic location.  The fort was destroyed in 1574 during the Chinese attack led by Limahong.  The stone fort was built between 1589 and 1592 and was repaired and extended after being damaged by the 1645 earthquake. Spanish, British, American and Japanese occupation forces used the fort as their headquarters and a prison for men, women, children and soldiers.  After its destruction during the Battle of Manila in 1945, the fort was used by the U.S. Transportation Corps as a depot until it was turned over to the Philippine government in 1946. In 1950, Fort Santiago was declared a Shrine of Freedom and restoration began the following year. Today, it stands as a memorial to the victims of World War II and the sacrifices of the Filipino people in pursuit of freedom.</p>

	<p>The famous Banaue Rice Terraces once were just winding fields that laid embracing a mountain side. Although the locals had totally abandoned this place, young farmers at the present day are reviving these plantations.</p>

	<p>Supporting the survival needs of many Ifugao natives since pre-colonial times, this mud and stone terraced rice field was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1995. The unique technique of water harvesting from the mist-clad mountaintops showcase the brilliant engineering skills that have been passed on from generation to generation.</p>

	<p>Influences of Spanish and Chinese architecture can also be seen in the design of this church. The large wooden doors of the church boast intricate carvings that add to the beauty of the chapel.</p>

	<p>Only about three hours north of Chiang Mai lays Chiang Rai, the largest northernmost city in Thailand. The White Temple Chiang Rai or Wat Rong Khun is a mesmerizing temple which is privately owned and at first sight, the White Temple may look like most other temples with the only exception of its pure white color.</p>

	<p>This perception may, however, last for a few minutes. In order to reach the main ordination hall or ubosot, one must cross a bridge over a small pond which contains dozens of koi fish of which some are even white. The arms and the bridge of the temple showcase that one has to first pass temptation before awarded success.</p>
	<p><b>Location:</b> Located 15 kilometers Southwest of Chiang Rai town and can be accessed by any transport apart from railways.</p>

	<p>The Temple of the Dawn or Wat Arun towers 260 ft above the Chao Phraya River. With fabulous views of the rising and setting sun, the temple is one of Bangkok's major tourist attractions after the Grand Palace.</p>

	<p>It is possible to climb the temple for views across the river to the Grand Palace and beyond, but its narrow steps are not for the faint-hearted.</p>
	<p><b>Location:</b> Located near the West bank of the Chao Phraya, opposite to Tha Thien Pier. Things to Keep in Mind: Once inside the temple grounds, visitors must be appropriately dressed and must remove their footwear. </p>
