	<font size="4"><p>Paris has always been enveloped by an enchanting aura of romance and vigour and standing in the heart of the city, lies the Eiffel Tower, wrapped in its air of beauty and cultural elegance. Your Paris trip would surely remain incomplete without a visit to the awe-inspiring Eiffel Tower. Built of 18,000 iron parts, the Eiffel Tower is popularly and aptly known as the “Iron Lady”. </p>
	<p>As you lay your foot on the grounds of Champ de Mars, the towering structure of one of the seven wonders of the world will pop up right in front of your eyes. Every year, hordes of tourists from different parts of the world flock to this place to behold the architectural beauty of the tower.</p>
	<p>As you ponder about it’s history dating back to 1889, you will surely get surprised at its cause of origin. Constructed to serve as a mere entrance to the World Fair back in 1889, today it stands as one of the most integral cultural icons of France. As you engage in an exploration of the three different levels of the tower, you will get mesmerised to find cafeterias, restaurants, souvenir shops, and scenic vantage points tucked in at each floor.</p>
	<p>The panoramic view of the Paris cityscape spread against the azure skyline is a pleasing sight to behold from the tower’s summit. As night descends, another spectacular sight of the Eiffel Tower illuminated with myriad bulbs will leave you in sheer awe. Thus, one can well understand that the tower is undeniably a tour de force of structural elegance and will turn out to be a worthwhile memory to cling onto for a lifetime.</p>

	<font size="4"><p>The historical museum is a piece of art in itself which symbolises different cultural innovations introduced in its architecture overtime since its construction in 1190. Extended over an area of 652,300 square feet, the museum was built in 1682. When Louis XIV shifted his royal residence from the palace to Versailles, it was left deserted and later on converted into a heaven for the art curators. In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte commissioned its transformation into a proper museum that would offer regular exhibitions of its member’s works here. </p>
	<p>This baroque styledbuilding holds as many as 35,000 works of various artists, antiques, historically important archeological items and much more. The most renowned of all the works presented at the museum are the painting of Mona Lisa made by Leonardo da Vinci, Samothrace’s Winged Victory, Michelangelo’s Dying Slave, Venus de Milo etc. The collection at the Louvre presents European art from all the different time periods as well as the personal collections of the kings of jewellery and other valuable items. The Egyptian antiques collected by Napoleon Bonaparte in the late 19th century are of particular notice. The museum is located in the centre of the city of Paris and is covered by a range of attractions like Place Colette, Place de la Concorde and Eiffel Tower, in close vicinity. </p>

	<font size="4"><p>Mont-Saint-Michel, France, is a magical island where you can find everything required to stimulate your imagination. You can get lost in the maze of cobbled roads, winding alleys, and hundreds of stairs. Its medieval shops, glaring gargoyles, and wiggly streets will transport you to an era of yore. One of the main attractions of Mont-Saint-Michel is the Abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel, which is a miracle of engineering and construction. The Abbey became a renowned learning center, attracting the greatest manuscript illuminators in Europe.</p>
	<p>Many small souvenir stores exist at the entrance of Mont-Saint-Michel, providing medieval artifacts, local souvenirs, and Japanese Samurai swords. The bay around the Mont-Saint-Michel is famed for its high tides, which can change rapidly and strand pedestrians who stray from the causeway linking the island. You'll also find a few expensive and premium hotels within the walls of Mont-Saint-Michel where you can have a magnificent stay. </p>
	<p>Your trip to Mont-Saint-Michel won't be complete if you don't savor an omelet at the restaurant of Mère Poulard. There are also many creperies scattered in the alleyways, serving scrumptious pancakes that you'll relish till the last bite. You can also see thousands of seagulls and gulls flying over Mont-Saint-Michel from the ramparts.</p>

	<font size="4"><p>The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is an 18th-century fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762 and several others. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3 ft) wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world.</p>
	<p>The fountain, at the junction of three roads (tre vie), marks the terminal point of the "modern" Acqua Vergine—the revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some 13 km (8.1 mi) from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain's façade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some 22 km (14 mi). This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years.</p>

	<p>The Pantheon is a former Roman temple and, since AD 609, a Catholic church (Basilica Santa Maria ad Martyres or Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs) in Rome, Italy. It was built on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14), then after that burnt down, the present building was ordered by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated c. AD 126. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple.</p>
	<p>The building is round in plan, except for the portico with large granite Corinthian columns (eight in the first rank and two groups of four behind) under a pediment. A rectangular vestibule links the porch to the rotunda, which is under a coffered concrete dome, with a central opening (oculus) to the sky. Almost two thousand years after it was built, the Pantheon's dome is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, 43 metres (142 ft).</p>
	<p>It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings, in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history. Since the 7th century, it has been a church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs (Latin: Sancta Maria ad Martyres) but informally known as "Santa Maria Rotonda". The square in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda. The Pantheon is a state property, managed by Italy's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio. In 2013, it was visited by over six million people.</p>
	<p>The Pantheon's large circular domed cella, with a conventional temple portico front, was unique in Roman architecture. Nevertheless, it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived, and has been copied many times by later architects.</p>

	<p>The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).</p>
	<p>The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</p>
	<p>Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.</p>

	<p>The park has 25 volcanoes located inside it, with one volcano still active. You can take guided walks or audio-guided bus tours of the park during your curated trips to Places to visit in Spain. You can also enjoy a camel ride and explore the volcanic landscape of the park. There is also an El Diablo restaurant that serves food cooked by using the heat of an active volcano.</p>
